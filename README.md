# Ai-campus-survilence-and-Violence-Detection-System
Modern surveillance systems rely heavily on human operators and lack intelligent event detection. This project proposes a multimodal deep learning-based surveillance platform combining video and audio inputs. The system uses YOLOv5, pose estimation, and MFCC-RNN to detect critical events automatically.
